# Optimizations:

## Dark Mode:

- Made a dark theme toggler using an event listener, listening to clicks on a button that toggles between dark and light by toggling css classes.
Thought about adding some ongoing animations but don't want anyone's laptop fans triggered.

- Also fixed theme reset to light them, cause it's the default one, by using localStorage to carry the theme selected through all pages.

## Performance optimizations:
- Added lazy loading for images that are seen after scrolling
- Replaced JPEGs with compressed WebP images.

# Lessons Learned:

Seperation of Concerns. css animations better be done in css, not with javascript.
